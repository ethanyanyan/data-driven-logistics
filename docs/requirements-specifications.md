### Security Requirements

The Data Driven Logistics (DDL) requires stringent security measures to protect sensitive data, ensure user privacy, and maintain system integrity against potential threats. Given the system's role in managing inventory across multiple locations and modeling business processes, security is paramount to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and service disruptions. Here are the key security requirements for the DDL:

#### Authentication and Authorization

- **Requirement**: Implement robust authentication mechanisms to verify the identity of users before granting access to the system. Utilize role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure users are authorized to access only the resources relevant to their role within the organization.
- **Rationale**: To prevent unauthorized access and ensure users can only perform actions permitted by their role, protecting sensitive data and critical functionalities.

#### Data Encryption

- **Requirement**: All data transmitted between the client and server must be encrypted using industry-standard protocols such as TLS (Transport Layer Security). Additionally, sensitive data stored in the MySQL database, such as user credentials and personal information, should be encrypted at rest.
- **Rationale**: To protect data integrity and confidentiality during transmission and storage, and to safeguard against eavesdropping or data theft.

#### Audit Logging

- **Requirement**: Maintain detailed audit logs of all user actions within the system, including login attempts, data modifications, and system configuration changes. These logs should be immutable and stored securely.
- **Rationale**: To provide an audit trail for forensic analysis in case of a security incident, ensuring accountability and facilitating the identification of malicious activities.

#### Input Validation and Sanitization

- **Requirement**: Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all user inputs and API requests to prevent common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and command injection attacks.
- **Rationale**: To protect the system from malicious inputs that could lead to unauthorized data access, data corruption, or system compromise.

#### Denial-of-Service (DoS) Protection

- **Requirement**: Deploy measures to detect and mitigate denial-of-service attacks, ensuring the system remains available to legitimate users. Consider rate limiting, traffic analysis, and cloud-based DoS protection services.
- **Rationale**: To maintain system availability and reliability, preventing service disruptions caused by malicious traffic overload.

#### Privacy and Confidentiality

- **Requirement**: Adhere to relevant data protection regulations (such as GDPR, CCPA) concerning user data privacy and confidentiality. Implement policies for data minimization, purpose limitation, and user consent for data collection and processing.
- **Rationale**: To ensure compliance with legal requirements, protect user privacy, and maintain trust in the system's handling of personal and sensitive information.

#### Regular Security Assessments

- **Requirement**: Conduct regular security assessments, including vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, and code reviews, to identify and remediate potential security weaknesses.
- **Rationale**: To proactively discover and fix vulnerabilities, reducing the risk of exploitation and enhancing overall system security.

These security requirements are essential for safeguarding the DDL against various cyber threats, ensuring the protection of sensitive data, and maintaining user trust and system integrity. Implementing these measures will address potential vulnerabilities and compliance requirements, contributing to a secure and reliable inventory management system.
