## Project Overview

Data Driven Logistics is a web-based application designed to empower businesses, specifically within the automotive manufacturing sector, to efficiently track and manage inventory across multiple physical locations. This solution enables the modeling of business processes, the recording of shipments, the tracking of inventory quantities, and provides a comprehensive audit trail of updates made by users. Data Driven Logistics aims to deliver real-time insights into inventory levels, ensuring businesses can make informed decisions to optimize their operations.

## Features

- **Real-Time Inventory Tracking**: View up-to-date inventory levels across all locations from a centralized dashboard.
- **Process Modeling**: Define and model key business processes to optimize production workflows.
- **Shipments Recording**: Log incoming and outgoing shipments, automatically updating inventory quantities.
- **Audit Trail**: Maintain a log of all system interactions for accountability and data integrity.
- **Reporting and Analytics**: Generate custom reports to analyze trends and performance.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive web interface for easy navigation and operation.
- **Security**: Robust authentication, authorization, and encryption mechanisms to protect sensitive data.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Development Tools**:
  - **Git**: Used for version control, allowing for efficient tracking of code changes and collaboration between developers.
  - **Postman**: An API platform for building and using APIs, used here for testing API endpoints, ensuring they behave as expected.
  - **Prettier**: A code formatter, enforcing a consistent code style across the project's codebase.

## System Requirements

- **Operating Systems**: Linux, Windows, macOS
- **Web Servers**: Supported via Node.js and Express
- **Databases**: MySQL Server 5.7 or newer
- **Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (with ES6 support)
- **Hardware (Recommended)**: 8 GB RAM, Multi-core CPU (2GHz or faster), 500 GB SSD

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Git

Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system. For installation instructions, visit the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and the [Docker Compose documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs506/sp2024/team/mondaywednesdaylecture/T_04/data-driven-logistics.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd data-driven-logistics
   ```

3. Environment Configuration:

- Before starting the application, you'll need to configure environment variables for the backend and database services. Create `.env` files based on the provided `.env.example` files in the `backend` and `database` directories.

4. Build and Start the Application with Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

5. Accessing the Application:

- Once the containers are up and running, you can access the frontend of the Data Driven Logistics application by visiting: `http://localhost:3000`.
- The backend API will be accessible at: `http://localhost:3001`.

### Shutting Down the Application

- To stop and remove the application containers, use the following Docker Compose command in the project directory:

  ```bash
  docker-compose down
  ```

- To also remove the volumes and network created by Docker Compose, add the `-v` option:

  ```bash
  docker-compose down -v
  ```

### Additional Commands

- **Rebuilding After Changes**: If you make changes to the source code, you can rebuild and restart the application with:

  ```bash
  docker-compose up --build
  ```

- **Viewing Logs**: To view the logs for running containers, use:

  ```bash
  docker-compose logs
  ```
